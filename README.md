Lists the development Idea conceived with date

- Rethink how Mysql migrations work (using Laravel migrations as case study)

## Github Bot
- add links of issues or repo (starred) to your list in a specific repo's Readme file and group them [13-07-2018] :question:

## Less Dev
- **Language Wrapper**: Write English in the minimized form to save space used, e.g Img-h=me represents I am going home. Why?
  - To save space used in writing (use case, if bible was on computers, would it exist today and still be valid?)
  - To preserve paper writings that should stay hundreds of years without Internet cloud storage
  - Needs to develop an **algorithm** that can restructure text string back to normal english, or use dictionary such as with Lemmatization, stopwords, or vectors in Text processing (or NLP)
  - Solved problem: Accessibility to your data is near you, since the trend nowadays is "go to the cloud", every of our personal data now stays far away from us into another person's machine which you need some security mechanism to access and also the permission is granted _if_ they like. What there's a central permission governing body that denies you access to those data, then you'd wish you had some on your own personal disk drive.
  - Untargetted problem: Security. There's no need to deny anyone access to this writing of yours especially if its from the bible. The world needs to hear the word of God.
  - Tech Inspiration: Byte codes, machine code, assembly language, Hashing, White Space programming language etc 
  - Non tech: shorthand;
  - Solution: unwrapping and wrapping with an algorithm.
  - Needs another form to represent English text (for now) that'll save space both on paper or storage mechanism.
  
## Proof of concept

- Immutable array in PHP (May need to code in C?)
- Functional Programming in PHP (may need to code in C?)
- Pipe functions `2 | sum` where `sum` is a function that takes value 2 as first parameter
